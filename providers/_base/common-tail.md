## Timeout

- Set Bash timeout to 120000ms (2 min) for simple tasks
- Set Bash timeout to 600000ms (10 min) for complex tasks

## Iteration

You may call the provider multiple times using resume:
- If the first response is incomplete, ask the provider to continue
- If the response needs refinement, send follow-up instructions
- Maximum 3 rounds unless the task clearly requires more

## Response Format

Return to Claude:

```
## Task
<what the provider was asked to do>

## Instance
<instance_key>

## Result
<key findings, code, suggestions, or outputs>

## Session
- ID: <session_id>
- Status: new | resumed
- Rounds: <number of CLI calls made>
```

## Rules

- Always manage sessions (read before, write after)
- If the provider needs file contents, read the file yourself and include it in the prompt
- If the provider produces code, verify it looks reasonable before returning
- Keep your summary focused — Claude doesn't need the full conversation log
